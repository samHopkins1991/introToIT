ENTJs have a natural tendency to marshall and direct. This may be expressed with the 
charm and finesse of a world leader or with the insensitivity of a cult leader. The 
ENTJ requires little encouragement to make a plan. One ENTJ put it this way... "I make 
these little plans that really don't have any importance to anyone else, and then feel 
compelled to carry them out." While "compelled" may not describe ENTJs as a group, 
nevertheless the bent to plan creatively and to make those plans reality is a common theme for NJ types.
ENTJs are often "larger than life" in describing their projects or proposals. This 
ability may be expressed as salesmanship, story-telling facility or stand-up comedy. 
In combination with the natural propensity for filibuster, our hero can make it very 
difficult for the customer to decline.<br> (Personality test based on C. Jung and I. Briggs Myers type theory, 2020)

<p class = "content">
If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. 
You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some
 type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and 
 with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.
As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or
 move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember 
 things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by 
 touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.<br>

<h3 class = "subHeading">What This All Means</h3>
<p class="content">
    Most of the results of these three online tests rings true to me. I need to set plans in place to have small achievable 
    goals that I can mark off as I progress. I know already that making plans to make plans irritates me, and almost 
    immediate direction is what I need, however, I need to be mindful of the other team members’ methods. I will have to 
    read each of my teammates profiles to better understand them and the way they operate. With regards to the learning style 
    test, I perform better with hands-on experience. This is supported by my drive for self learning, that may be outside the 
    scope of what is prescribed. Finally, with the big 5 personality test, the key takeaway is that I am more confident and 
    secure (less neurotic), which fits in with my willingness to ask for feedback on subjects that I am not fully educated on.
