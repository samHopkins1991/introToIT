    <h3 class="subHeading">My Description</h3>
    <p class="content">
        

       
        
        A full stack web developer knows and works on both the client side and the server side of an I.T project. The reasons why being a fullstack developer appeals to me are; 1 - constant learning; 2 - flexibility of work;  and 3 - being able to complete a project solo. <br><br>
        
        The areas of competence of a full stack web developer are naturally very broad, and due to this, people who perform this work are constantly looking to improve and constantly learning. This ticks a hugely important box that I have in order to be fulfilled and motivated in a work role. <br><br>
        
        Having a career which is flexible around home life is not an absolute must, but having that trait is attractive in a work role. <br><br>
        
        Finally, being able to complete a project solo leaves open many doors. It allows one to complete pet projects, or to be entrepreneurial and start on large projects with the hope of monetizing it.

<h3 class="subHeading">Skills Required</h3>

<ul class= "content">
    <li>Front end - E.g HTML JavaScript, CSS etc</li>
    <li>Backend - E.g Ruby, Python, PHP</li>
    <li>Database - E.g SQL </li>
</ul>
<p class = "content">
Full stack developers also need to know industry best practices and be aware of best user experiences. 
</p>

<h3 class="subHeading">Current Skills</h3>

    <ul class = "content">
        <li>Completed Intro to JavaScript via Khan Academy</li>
        <li>Completed Intro to HTML/CSS via Khan Academy</li>
        <li>Completed Intro to SQL via Khan Academy</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="subHeading">My Plan</h3>
<p class = "content">
    My plan to work towards being capable of fulfilling the role of a full stack developer can be boiled down to learning, and performing each of the required skills I listed above. First I will become proficient enough to build a website through HTML/CSS. I neednâ€™t be an expert, but be practiced enough to use my growing knowledge base, and then complement it with the use of documentation in order to build new skills within these languages.<br>
    The same can be said of JS and explore ways in which it can interact with my HTML/CSS.  I will then aim to transition into building web apps. I will search for employment in front end development, while I begin to learn back end languages and expand my use of database systems such as SQL. Eventually, I plan to be experienced in each aspect, and be employed as a full stack developer
